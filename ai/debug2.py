You are developing an application to manage sensor data for IoT systems. Specifically, the sensor readings are stored in a binary search tree (BST) structure where each node contains a single unique timestamp as the node's key along with a sensor reading. You need to design functionality to retrieve all sensor readings in order that were recorded within a specific time range, while doing so, you have noticed that something is not working as expected.
